// // Let's consider a real-life example of polymorphism. A lady behaves like a teacher in a classroom, mother or daughter in a home and customer in a market. Here, a single person is behaving differently according to the situations.
// there are two types of polymorphism 
// run time and compile time 
// runtime p.  is done by virtual functions
// compile time polymorphism is done by function overloading and operator overloading
