// // In C++, inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other class

// C++ supports five types of inheritance:

// Single inheritance
// Multiple inheritance
// Hierarchical inheritance
// Multilevel inheritance
// Hybrid inheritance
